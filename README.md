# Data-Cleaning-EDA-Python

This is a training task for data preprocessing (cleaning & transformation) and exploratory data analysis (EDA) in an online course that I am taking.

### Data:

### Headers:

["symboling","normalized-losses","make","fuel-type","aspiration", "num-of-doors","body-style",
         "drive-wheels","engine-location","wheel-base", "length","width","height","curb-weight","engine-type",
         "num-of-cylinders", "engine-size","fuel-system","bore","stroke","compression-ratio","horsepower",
         "peak-rpm","city-mpg","highway-mpg","price"]

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
Includes:

* Check for duplicate data
* Identify data with incorrect values (non-alphanumeric characters)
* Replace incorrect values (non-alphanumeric characters) with appropriate values
* Handle missing values (drop & fill)
* Reformat incorrect data types
* Reformat data in the form of measurement

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Includes:

* Descriptive statistics of the data
* Distribution of the target feature
* Distribution of categorical features
* Distribution of numerical features
* Exploration of specific categorical features vs. target feature
* Correlation between numerical features and the target feature
* Data visualization
